/**
 * Client Version.
 * This is a nice tool for minecraft's client protocol versions.
 * You won't have to memorize the protocol version, just memorize the client version
 * as the version you see in the minecraft launcher.
 * Some enum constants may represent two or more versions as there have been cases where some versions have the same protocol version due to no protocol changes.
 * We added a comment over those enum constants so check it out.
